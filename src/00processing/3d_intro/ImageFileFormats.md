# Image File Formats

- JPEG (.jpeg, .jpg)
  - good for images, but lossy (blurs the image)
- PNG (.png)
  - Not as good compression for pictures
  - (can be lossless)
  - good for sharp edges in diagrams
- gif
  - animated
  - IBM proprietary format
- webp
  - google format dominating both of the above
  - better compression (30%) for images than jpeg
  - better compression for diagrams than png
  - lossless (unless you want to lose resolution)
  - supports animation
  - not supported much
    - except for browsers
