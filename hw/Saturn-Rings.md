# Saturn Rings

Use a texture from PlanetPixelEmporium and create a spherical Saturn, adding a ring.

The ring must be transparent at some points, so convert the jpegs
from Planet pixel emporium to a single png and edit transparency.
This will require using gimp or photoshop.

Write a program that displays Saturn, but put something in the background so we can see through the rings in the band.
