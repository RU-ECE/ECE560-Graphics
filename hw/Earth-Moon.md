# Earth-Moon

Write a program to draw the earth-moon system with textures,
where the earth is tilted at
23.5 degrees off the ecliptic, rotating counterclockwise, and the moon
orbits the earth approximately every 28.5 days, with the moon always
facing the earth.

In this case, the orientation of the moon and the rotation of the moon are in sync so no correction is required.

The distance between the earth and moon is not important. It can be to scale if you want. The moon is 30 earth diameters away, and is approximately 1/4 the diameter of earth.
